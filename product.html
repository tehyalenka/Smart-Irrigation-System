      A smart irrigation system typically includes several components that work 
      together to efficiently water plants and landscapes. Here are some of the 
      key product contents of a smart irrigation system:
    </p>
    <p class="pro-2"> 
      Smart controller: The smart controller is the central component 
      of the system. It uses sensors, weather data, and other information to 
      automatically adjust watering schedules and amounts to meet the specific 
      needs of the plants and soil.
    </p>
    <p class="pro-3">
      Soil moisture sensors: These sensors measure the moisture content of the 
      soil and send that information to the smart controller. This helps the system 
      to determine when to water and how much water to apply.
    </p>
    <p class="pro-4">
      Water flow sensors: These sensors measure the amount of water flowing through 
      the irrigation system. This helps the system to detect leaks, breaks, or other 
      problems and to shut off the water supply if necessary.
    </p>
    <p class="pro-5">
      Overall, a smart irrigation system is designed to provide efficient, precise, 
      and customized watering for plants and landscapes, while also helping to 
      conserve water and reduce water waste.
